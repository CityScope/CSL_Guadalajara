#### 1 Clone the repository
If you’re a collaborator, Git Clone the project. Don’t fork it.

Open Terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

Type git clone, and then paste the URL of the project.

#### 2 Collaborating
When working on the same project with multiple people is needed to keep Master deployable. Create new branches for new features and the person in charge of handling merging will merge them into Master when they’re completed.

Type git checkout -b “New_branch_name”
